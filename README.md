Amazon headphone scraping from the search.

Python file belongs to my scrapy project spiders.
Definitely, python file can be done way more simplistic like gathering things (that repeats) in a class. But I just randomly get in, and after completition I just uploaded it. Later I might update.

I changed the json file a little bit with pandas module.
